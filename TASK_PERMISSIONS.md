# Task Creator & Receiver Permission Rules

## 🎯 Overview
The AGGRANDIZE Dashboard now implements clear role-based permissions for task management, distinguishing between **Task Creators** and **Task Receivers** with specific capabilities.

## 👥 Role Definitions

### 🟢 **Task Creator**

- Visual indicators with inline styles
- Clean role-based conditional rendering

### Security
- Frontend permissions for UX only
- Database-level security through RLS policies
- All actions validated server-side

This permission system ensures clear roles, prevents confusion, and maintains task integrity while enabling effective team collaboration! 🎉
